systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return \\r\\nback has become automatic.

Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of \\r\\nover 500 thousands bicycles.

Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration\\r\\nof travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems.

Therefore the data can be used for validation of anomaly or event detection algorithms as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Files\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t* hour.csv : bike sharing counts aggregated on hourly basis.
